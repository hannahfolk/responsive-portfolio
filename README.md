This is a responsive version of a portfolio. Breakpoints are at widths of 640 px, 768px, and 980px. The responsiveness is achieved through the Bootstrap grid, and the main Bootstrap components that I used are Navbar, Forms, Image Responsiveness, and Containers.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Process
    
I started out by taking the HTML and CSS from the previous homework and just copying and pasting it into my new repository. Then I added the Bootstrap framework. Starting this way was extremely frustrating because I did not know what Bootstrap was overriding or how to fix what it had changed. Then I just commented out all of my old stuff and started building from scratch again, referring to last week's homework only for colors, fonts, and spacing. Eventually,I managed to find out what Bootstrap was taking over, and learned to build from Bootstrap first, and then adding on my custom CSS later.

The most frustrating thing on this week's homework was the navigation bar and the responsiveness of it. The breakpoints for 768px and 980px made sense, but the format of the heading changed at 640px, so eventually I decided to use a media query to fix this part of the navigation bar.
